#summary Core solver of position or object's shape

= Introduction =

Core solvers such as fundamental 7/8 point, 5-point euclidean relative pose, 5-point euclidean resection, etc. These involve a small, fixed number of points or cameras.

= Details =

As proposed by Pierre Moulon, I will create a wiki page for each method of the core problems. This will improve exchange between users and developers.
For now, we have:
 * [5ptRelative 5 pt relative pose]
 * [8ptFundam 8 pt fundamental matrix]
 * [HEstim Homography  estimation]
 * [Resectioning Euclidean re-sectioning]
 * [Triangulation Triangulation, two views and n -view.]
 * [Radialdist Radial distortion and undistortion]
