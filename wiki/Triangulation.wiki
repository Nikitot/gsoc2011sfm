#summary Can find the position of points when having points and projections matrix

= Introduction =
Thank's to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation wikipedia], a triangulation is the process of determining the location of a point by measuring angles to it from known points at either end of a fixed baseline, rather than measuring distances to the point directly (trilateration). The point can then be fixed as the third point of a triangle with one known side and two known angles.

Donâ€™t know where triangulations stuff are hidden...

They use the classic linear triangulation method (see `triangulation.cc`). They propose an other implementation of this problem using triangulation by plan with minimization of the re-projection error in the first image only.
