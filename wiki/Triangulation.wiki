#summary Can find the position of points when having points and projections matrix

= Introduction =
Thank's to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation wikipedia], a triangulation is the process of determining the location of a point by measuring angles to it from known points at either end of a fixed baseline, rather than measuring distances to the point directly (trilateration). The point can then be fixed as the third point of a triangle with one known side and two known angles.
==Implementation idea:==
As this method needs 2D points correspondences and camera parameters, it should inherit from a class like "!StructureEstimator". This could help Level2 algorithm to handle such algorithms.

= How it's done =
==Opencv==

Donâ€™t know where triangulations stuff are hidden...
We can use `CalibrateCamera2` to find the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from several views of a calibration pattern. This function can estimate the distortions parameters too.
==Libmv==
They use the classic linear triangulation method (see `triangulation.cc`). They propose an other implementation of this problem using triangulation by plan with minimization of the re-projection error in the first image only.
