= Bundle adjustement =

When using a few matches (approx 80) between two cameras, the bundle adjustement find a strange solution: the two cameras are really close... I made a video to show this:

As you see, before bundle adjustment, the configuration is close to the correct one, but after nothing is good :(

= KRT_from_P problems =

Thanks to [http://michot.julien.free.fr/drupal/index.php Julien Michot], this problem is now solved. Thanks again for this!


= Automatic tracking =

Even using fundamental constraints, the matches are sometimes not good... How can we robustly reject outliers even if they are on epilines? 

This problem is not really problematic for now because I use fully parameterized camera so I can reject bad matches using reprojection error, but when dealing with real data, we will have to face such problem!
