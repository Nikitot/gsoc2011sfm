#summary Class which represent a field of view

This wiki page is not the API documentation. Indeed, Doxygen will do it for us. It's only for sharing ideas...

= Role =

Represent a field of view : a 3D position and direction of a [Camera]. So only extern parameters should be present in attribute and a reference to the Camera which take the picture.

There is two major scenarios:
 * a single camera take all FoV.
 * a different camera for each FoV.

The FoV owns a picture (2D, RGB, gray or B&W) which can be used to compute points ([PointsToTrack]). These points can be loaded from files (PCD) or computed using OpenCV technics.

A FoV owns a vector of points matches ([PointsMatched]) which can be used to relate the current FoV to other FoV from the same scene.

The *extern parameters* can then being computed using matches and *intra parameters* can being updated in Camera object.

= Attributes =
{{{
cv::Mat image;
Camera device;//intra parameters
PointsToTrack pointsInfo;
vector<PointsMatched> matches;
vector<ExternPosEstim> externMats;//extern pos estimated (when no word coordinate are available)
Points3DEstim points3D;//for each point in pointsInfo, estimation of the 3D position...
}}}
