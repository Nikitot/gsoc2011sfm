#summary Euclidean reconstruction of a sequence

= Introduction =

This tutorial will try to introduce the "euclidean reconstruction" offered by this API. This means that we will see how we can find camera position and geometry automatically!

For ease of reading, in this tuto we expect that the intra parameters don't change across the sequence. It's not a strong requirement as this API allow wariations, but it's easier to explain.

We need an estimation of the intra configuration of the camera. We need theses five parameters:
  * The focal (x) (value usually between 1000 and 2500)
  * The focal_y_ (can be set equal to focal_x_)
  * The principal_point_x_ (can be set to image width/2)
  * The principal_point_y_ (can be set to image height/2)
  * The skew (can be set to 0)

As the points detection, extraction and matching are fully parametrable, we have to choose the one we will use. For details about detectors, we can [PointsToTrack_tut read this tutorial] or see the [http://opencv.itseez.com/modules/features2d/doc/feature_detection_and_description.html Opencv reference manual]. For the matching, [Matching_tuto this tutorial] explains the correct relation between matcher and descriptors...
