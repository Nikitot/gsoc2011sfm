#summary Abstract class to search for points matching

This wiki page is not the API documentation. Indeed, Doxygen will do it for us. It's only for sharing ideas...

= Role =

The aim of this class is to find good matches between points of FieldOfView.
We have to take into account:
 * Possibility to match 2/more different views
 * Possibility to use features of point when available
 * Use the fundamental matrix to improve the matching estimation

= Attributes =
{{{
vector<FieldOfView > foVs;
map<int,int> matches;
}}}
